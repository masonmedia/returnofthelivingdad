      "body": "<p>I’m a Dad. It’s still staggeringly accepted that Dads have little to do with the parenting process. If not so extreme, it’s at minimum accepted that Moms are the ones that still do all the heavy lifting. Dads that are “involved” in 2023. They show up to a couple things, do some drops off, and everyone thinks they’re progressive. I watched a talk show the other day that got into bullying. It was all “Mama bear” this and “No offence to the Dads in the audience, but the Moms take care of this stuff” that. I was like fuck you. I still want to crush the little shit in my oldest’s class that keeps giving unsolicited, space-violating hugs. And of course in practice these social constructs aren’t true. Dads now are in large part equal parents with their partners. They do fully half (or more) of the work—from household management, to school drop offs, parenting, research, shopping, etc.—that would traditionally be assumed by the Mother. I want to be the best, most available, most supportive, most loving, most nurturing, most protective, most educational parent I can possibly be. And I don’t attribute this to something only Moms or Dads do. It’s just parenting. Loving your kids. As such, my wife and I have shared equally in the extreme difficulty of these first years of our kids’ lives. As I write this, in the quiet of a house with kids at daycare, finally about 75% healthy after an episode of Strep throat, followed promptly by an extreme bout of Norovirus, I feel confident in saying I am better for it. Check back with me after pick up time. I might have a different answer.</p><p>I wrote most of the content in this book directly after brutal, terrible, nervous-breakdown-inducing kid-incidents: terrible screaming nights, terrible screaming car rides, terrible screaming afternoons for no reason (or maybe it was just hunger), terrible screaming mornings after starting out just fine, terrible screaming leaving-the-house incidents, terrible mood swings. It makes for some brutal, cynical, depressing (and hopefully funny) writing. And in spite of this, it should be said that the sweet, loving, quiet moments you see in magazines and on social media <em>do</em> happen: and they’re pure gold. They make it all worthwhile (almost). No they really do (mostly). They do.</p><p>It’s just that the mania and unrelentingness of parenting (at least in my life, with my kids) is so much, so constant, so intense, so crushing, so exhausting, so underrepresented, so glazed-over and “positivized” by parent (Mom) blogs and Instagram feeds and Christmas card photos and wannabe influencers and friends afraid that if they tell the truth about the insanity of it, everyone will think they’re bad people or shitty parents or that it’s actually hard - that the reality of it needs to be laid out in all its gory detail.</p><p>It also needs to be said that every time I dive back in here to add a section or elaborate on another nightmare scenario, or rant about another episode of sickness (like right now), there is more to add. There are updates that can be made. There are things (a lot) that can change. My youngest kid is older and doing more. My oldest kid is older and doing more. Things are better and things are worse. There are more hilarious scenes. There are more horrifying and completely dehumanizing scenes. I’ll have to at some point just accept that there is enough in here to give you a basic idea, and the rest—I’ll save for Vol. 2.</p>",
